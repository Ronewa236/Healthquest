# Healthquest

This is a readme file for Healthquest application repository

Healthquest application is an app that connects service providers ( Phamacy and other health facilities) with ordinary people (customers). Ordinary people will be able to make appointment so that they can see a doctor withought travelling and also purchace medicine online.

My application is going to use kotlin and firebase. I will also use Android IDE to develop it. The final product is going to be deployed to google play.The intended users of the application are the middleclass and anyone who can afford to go private clinics.

i want to connect medical facilities with their customers and also provide a platform that allows medical facilities to compete because competition is the root of a good service.
